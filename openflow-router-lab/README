Run "sudo setup_of_router_lab.sh" to initialize the routers and hosts for the lab. "sudo clean_of_router_lab.sh" cleanly tears down thenvironment.

**** Pre-Requisites ****
- Ubuntu 12.04 or later
- apt-get install openvswitch-switch


**** Testing The Setup ****
setup_of_router_lab.sh creates 2 IP namespaces: 10_20_30_0 and 30_20_10_0.  The host interfaces are "host1" and "host2". "host1" is in namespace 10_20_30_0, "host2" is in namespace 30_20_10_0.

Ping host1 to host2:

sudo ip netns exec 10_20_30_0 ping -I host1 30.20.10.2

Ping host2 to host1:

sudo ip netns exec 10_20_30_0 ping -I host2 10.20.30.2
